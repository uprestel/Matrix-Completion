# Matrix Completion
This repository is part of the project for the lecture "Compressed Sensing"

In this project we explore the DRS (Douglas-Rachford-Splitting) and FISTA algorithms within the framework of the matrix completion problem.
We apply the mentioned algorithms to image inpainting / reconstruction and the Netflix problem.

To run the project in google-colab, just use this button: [![Google Colab](https://badgen.net/badge/Launch/on%20Google%20Colab/blue?icon=terminal)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/uprestel/Matrix-Completion/blob/antonio/Matrix-Completion.ipynb)
